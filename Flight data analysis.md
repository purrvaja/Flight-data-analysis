>The [data](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7) consists of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights on major carriers within the USA for the years 2006 and 2007. Python and R have been used seperately to carry out an in-depth analysis to provide both passengers and airports with insights about flight delays and minimising them, along with the flying patterns of passengers. 
>
>The data has been analysed to answer the following five questions:

 1. When is the best time of day, day of the week, and time of year to
    fly to minimise delays?
    
 2. Do older planes suffer more delays?
 3. How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
 4. Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others?
 5. Use the available variables to construct a model that predicts delays.
